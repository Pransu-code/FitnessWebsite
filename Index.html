					<h3>Beginner</h3>
					<p>If you're just getting started in the gym (or starting over), 
						use this routine for 4 weeks straight. It will create intensity,
						consistency, and longevity that you've never had before in your workout program.
						 The problem with people talking about "hard work" and "habit" and "discipline" 
						 is that it always lacks specificity. What hard word exactly yields the results? 
						 Lots of people try really hard, use ineffective methods, and walk away from fitness 
						 altogether: "It's impossible. I just can't do it."This program explains the right way 
						 to work out for beginners in a way that is informative, but not overwhelming. Master
						  these simple fundamentals, and there won't be much left to learn about fitness. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="exercise-col">
					<h3>Intermediate</h3>
					<p>Start with a light weight and aim to do between 8-12 reps. If you can't do eight reps, 
						the weight is too heavy and you should go lighter. If you can do more than 12, 
						try upping the weight! Beginner recap tip - Resistance training is best done separately to cardio.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="exercise-col">
					<h3>Advance</h3>
					<p>The Ultimate Workout Routine for Men and Women (Tailored for Different Fitness Level) specifically for those who have spent years doing workouts either at home or at gym
						This include higher reps and sets of legs chest barbel push ups,triceps sets including 5 to 10 reps of each set
						.moreover deadly diamond pushups and widehand pushups up to 20 25 reps of each set.
